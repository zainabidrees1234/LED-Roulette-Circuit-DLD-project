# Project Title: LED Roulette Circuit with Adjustable Speed Using 555 Timer and 4017 IC
# OBJECTIVE
The aim of this project is to design and implement an LED roulette circuit that demonstrates sequential LED flashing, controlled using a 555 timer IC in a stable mode and a 4017-decade counter IC. This project integrates fundamental digital logic design concepts, such as clock pulse generation, sequential logic, and counter operation.
